# Continued development

Hello !
This project is the first project in which I've really started from scratch without any design/api provided.
The design is obviously not as good as my previous projects and there is still a lot of issues to fix on it, but I'm pretty happy that I was able to make a website that is somewhat functional.
I will make some updates on it and don't hesitate to give me ways to enhance my project !
